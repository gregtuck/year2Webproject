        <h2>This section is about the one moment music video</h2>

        <p>The band released a video associated with the song, its production sponsored by Morton Salt to highlight
            their
            "Walk Her Walk" campaign. The one-shot video primarily consists of 4.2 seconds of real-time footage
            recording
            over 300 distinct events set in motion by the band members and timed devices, slowed down to be played over
            the
            length of the song.</p>

        <p>The music video for "The One Moment" features the members of OK Go interacting with various props on an
            initially stark-white set. Many of the props are inflated balloons filled with colored liquid that splash
            across the set pieces and the band members as they are ruptured in time to the music. The bulk of the video
            is shown in slow motion, at times slowed at 20,000% from real-time speed to match the beat of the song.</p>

        <p> Morton Salt provided financial support for the video.The company had wanted to change its brand image to
            demonstrate that its salt was more than just a commodity but is used across a range of industries that
            affects everyday life. They reused their mascot, the Morton Salt Girl, as part of this new branding
            campaign, "Walk Her Walk", to show about making a positive impact. Morton's CEO Christian Herrmann stated
            that "We want to embody her spirit to make a real, tangible difference in people's lives."The company
            approached the band about creating a video to help with this new campaign, as they felt the band would help
            "to bring new meaning to the brand and create relevance, especially with millennials", according to Morton's
            director of communications and corporate brand strategy Denise Lauer. The two groups agreed that "The One
            Moment" seemed to fit best, as the song was about the importance of every moment. The video includes
            images of five "difference makers" that Morton felt would help inspire viewers to make a positive impact on
            the world. The video concludes with the image of the Morton Salt Girl as well.</p>
